    <h3>THESPIANS - ACT II - The same Scene, with the Ruins Restored</h3>
    <h4>ACT II<br>
        SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
  of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
  interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
  of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
  back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
  gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
  grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
  drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.<br>

    </h4>
    <pre>
        <b>CHO</b> Of all symposia
        The best by half
        Upon Olympus, here await us.
        We eat ambrosia.
        And nectar quaff,
        It cheers but don't inebriate us.
        We know the fallacies,
        Of human food
        So please to pass Olympian rosy,
        We built up palaces,
        Where ruins stood,
        And find them much more snug and cosy.
        <b>SILL</b> To work and think, my dear,
        Up here would be,
        The height of conscientious folly.
        So eat and drink, my dear,
        I like to see,
        Young people gay—young people jolly.
        Olympian food my love,
        I'll lay long odds,
        Will please your lips—those rosy portals,
        What is the good, my love
        Of being gods,
        If we must work like common mortals?
        <b>CHO</b> Of all symposia...etc.

        [Exeunt all but Nicemis, who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia,
        who is dressed as Venus. They take Sillimon's arm and bring him
        down]
        <b>SILL</b> Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
        the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
        make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
        when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
        wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
        my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.

        <b>PRET</b> You certainly are a dear old thing.
        <b>SILL</b> She says I'm a dear old thing.  Deputy Venus says I'm a
        dear old thing.
        <b>NICE</b> It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
        terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
        that you are certainly a very dear old thing.
        <b>SILL</b> Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
        who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
        with such deputy divinities.
