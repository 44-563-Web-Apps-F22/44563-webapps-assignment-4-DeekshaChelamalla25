    <h3>THESPIANS - ACT II - The same Scene, with the Ruins Restored</h3>
    <h4>ACT II<br>
        SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
  of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
  interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
  of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
  back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
  gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
  grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
  drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.<br>

        the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
        make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
        when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
        wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
        my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.</p>
